        <h1> About Us </h1>
        <br>
        <br>
            <p> We are a small North-West London based company that sells Rum punch made with premium Caribbean rum with a variety of juices and fruits. We run a system where the pick up and delivery happens Friday-Sunday unless a special request is made. Our products are made fresh within the week you are picking up your order, so that you get the best tasting punch you can. Our punches are best when cold but many customers enjoy it frozen as it becomes almost like a slushie.</p> 
        <br>        
            <p>Rum Shak and Gorilla Punch are our only two flavours at the moment with more coming soon. The original flavour, Rum Shak, is the sweeter of the two tasting more like juice than an alcoholic beverage but trust us when we say you will feel the rum. Gorilla has a stronger and more citrusy flavour to it.</p>
